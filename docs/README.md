### API

#### `makeHistoryDriver(options: Object): Function`
This is a factory function which creates the history driver using the provided options. All options available are

  - <h5 style="margin:0;">hash :</h5>
    Enable or disable the use of hash based routing instead of the History API. If the browser does not support the History API it is enabled automatically. By default it is `false`.
  - <h5 style="margin:0;margin-top:0.35em;">queries :</h5>
    Enable or disable [Query Support](https://github.com/rackt/history/blob/master/docs/QuerySupport.md). By default it is `true`.
  - <h5 style="margin:0;margin-top:0.25em;">basename: </h5>
    Set a basename for the History API to manage. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/rackt/history/blob/master/docs/BasenameSupport.md). By default it is an empty string `""`.
  - <h5 style="margin:0;margin-top:0.25em;">history: </h5>
    Set driver to use already existing instance of history. Typical use case is to share history with React Router.
    React Router can be used to navigate "by clicking" through React views while using Cycle history driver to change navigation programmatically outside of React components (services, middlewares., models...).

Further options available are all of those available to `rackt/history`'s `createHistory(options)` method. The documentation for `rackt/history` is available [here](https://github.com/rackt/history/tree/master/docs).

###### Example
```js
makeHistoryDriver({
  hash: false,
  queries: true,
  basename: '/blog',
  // any other options from rackt/history
})
```
The function returned `historyDriver(url$)` is what Cycle interacts with. More information available [here](https://github.com/cyclejs/cycle-history/tree/master/docs/historyDriver.md)

#### `makeServerHistoryDriver(Location: Object): Function`

When using Cycle to create an isomorphic/universal application you likely want to incorporate your routing solution. This function makes it possible to do just that.

This function expects a [Location object](https://github.com/rackt/history/blob/master/docs/Location.md) as input. Please read the documentation on that page if you wish to use this.

###### Example
```js
import { makeServerHistoryDriver } from '@cycle/history'
import { createLocation } from 'history'

makeServerHistoryDriver(
  createLocation( req.url, {
    state: 'generated/retrieved on the server',
  })
)
```

###### Example for integration with React Router
```js
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { makeServerHistoryDriver } from '@cycle/history'
import { createHistory } from 'history'
import { Router } from 'react-router'
import routes from './routes'

const history = createHistory()

const drivers = {
  history: makeServerHistoryDriver({history})
}

// Cycle.run(main, drivers) etc.

render(
  <Router history={history} routes={routes} />,
  document.getElementById('app-container')
)  
```

#### `filterLinks(event: Event): Boolean`

This is a helper function which allows the filtering of links. When you click a link that should be handled by your application it will accept it, but if it is an external/download/etc link not meant to be handled internally it will be ignored.

###### Example
```js
import { filterLinks } from '@cycle/history'

function intent({ DOM }) {
  const click$ = DOM
    .select('a')
    .events('click')
    .filter(filterLinks)

  return {
    click$,
  }
}
```

# Not a router

This driver is not intended to be a full-featured router. To achieve this kind of functionality you can use a route matching library like:

- [switch-path](https://github.com/staltz/switch-path
  ) by Andr√© Staltz
- [url-mapper](https://github.com/christianalfoni/url-mapper) by Christian Alfoni
